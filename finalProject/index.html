        <h1>Why You Should Adopt A Pet?</h1>
        <p>I chose this topic because so many animals are getting abused every day. Most people go out to buy pets in pet shops and don't think about adopting animals from the animal shelter. Either they don't know about the shelters in their area or they simply don't want to go through the trouble. What they don't realize is that when you adopt an animal, they will be saving money and save a pet's life.</p>
